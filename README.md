# My Telegram AI bot
A barely working, pretty slow Telegram bot that uses Openrouter to talk to you.

How to use: -
1) Download the ```bot.py``` file, and the ```.env``` file
2) Replace the API Keys in the ```.env``` file with your own
3) OPTIONAL (linux): open a new terminal with tmux or screen
4) Run ```python3 bot.py```

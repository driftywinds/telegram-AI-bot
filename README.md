# My Telegram AI bot
A barely working, pretty slow python Telegram bot that uses Gemini API to talk to you.

Features: -
1) Replies instantly
2) Can analyze images and files
3) It's personalized, and on Telegram
4) Should have working memory too, but haven't extensively tested that yet

How to use: -
1) Download the ```bot.py``` file, and the ```.env``` file and keep them together in the same directory
2) Replace the API Keys in the ```.env``` file with your own
3) OPTIONAL (linux): open a new terminal with tmux or screen
4) Run ```python3 bot.py```
